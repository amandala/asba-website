<span><strong>Latest release notes: </strong>This is another important release, following the former 3.3.0 that introduced many form field types. With this release the plugin obtains two new features, <strong>responsiveness</strong> and the ability to be added in <strong>sidebars</strong>. The new attribute <strong>fitmode</strong> defines responsiveness. If it is set to <em>"fixed"</em> then nothing changes. However, if it is set to <em>"responsive"</em> then the plugin's element positions will be adjusted (wrapped) to fit inside the container page or post. Furthermore, a new widget, <strong>"Wordpress File Upload Form"</strong> has been added in the Widgets area of the Dashboard. If it is added inside a sidebar, then the uploader form will show up in place. Again, the shortcode can be configured either manually from the Dashboard or straight using the Shortcode Composer.</span>
